<p> I'm 19 years old and I'm addicted to chicken nuggets. </p>
<p> I only say that because I am a manager at McDonald's in Tecumseh. I have a younger sister named Amelia. When I was five years old my parents moved us from our home in Windsor to the Southern US where I grew up. My family moved back to Canada when I was 17 and I finished high school at St. Anne High School. After finishing the Graphic Design program I will be doing Travel and Tourism in the hopes of becoming a travel photographer after school. </p>
